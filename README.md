# dbt_intro
In this repo, I created my first project using dbt.
I used dbt with Google BigQuery to transform some data that consists of 4 tables through diferent levels of transformations.
At the end, I build two aggregated tables from two dimensions, one for orders per customer, and another the amount of orders per country.
