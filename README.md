# dbt_intro
In this repo, I created a simple project using dbt as part of the dbt fundamentals course.
I used dbt with Google BigQuery to transform some data that consists of 4 tables through different levels of transformations.
In the end, I build two aggregated tables from two dimensions, one for orders per customer, and another for the amount of orders per country.
